# Zoneminder in a Docker container
This is an attemp to bring Zoneminder in a Docker container, using the instructions from the [documentation](https://zoneminder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installationguide/ubuntu.html), and using the [script provided by Andrew Bauer](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zmdockerfiles/blob/master/utils/entrypoint.sh), in order to get the 1.36 and 1.37 version, in my own way, and available at GitHub Container Registry.
